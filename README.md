## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

This was my first time diving this deep into Swift. I am still very much in the process of clearing this steep learning curve. This is what I had the most trouble with, making a product knowing virtually nothing about Swift. I used a number of online resources including Youtube and ChatGPT. Sources I used for code will be listed on this README as well as in the code. <ins>**I also could not get the hang of constraints. Due to this, it is better to run my app on an iPhone 15 Pro Simulator.**</ins> Although I found it difficult to wrap my head around Swift and iOS development, I am proud of this little app I made and I am eager to learn more! 

Some knowledge gaps I have when it comes to iOS development:
- Objective C
- Some OOP concepts that Swift operates with
- Full picture of how an iOS app is developed

I will be researching the listed topics to prepare for any future assignments!
